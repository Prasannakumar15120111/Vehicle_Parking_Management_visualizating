The purpose of this project is to create a vehicle parking management system using MySQL for the database and Python for the backend logic. This system aims to provide functionalities for managing users, vehicles, parking lots, parking slots, reservations, and payments within a parking facility.

Here's an overview of the functionalities this system would typically include:

User Management: Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. Different user types, such as Admin and RegularUser, may have different privileges within the system.

Vehicle Management: Users can register their vehicles, including details such as license plate, type, brand, model, and color.

Parking Lot Management: Admins can add, edit, and remove parking lots, specifying details like name, location, capacity, and operating hours.

Parking Slot Management: Admins can define parking slots within each parking lot, specifying their size (Compact, Regular, Large) and current status (Available, Occupied, Reserved).

Reservation System: Users can reserve parking slots for specific vehicles for a defined duration. Reservations include details such as the user, vehicle, parking slot, reservation time, start time, and end time.

Payment Handling: Users can make payments for their reservations using different payment methods (Credit Card, Debit Card, Cash, Online). Payments include details such as the reservation ID, amount, payment method, payment time, and payment status.

Reporting and Analytics: The system may include functionalities for generating reports and analytics, such as parking occupancy rates, revenue generated, and popular parking times.
